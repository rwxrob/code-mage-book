== Get a computer

Before embarking on your journey to craft Go-based command-line applications, you’ll need an enchanted workstation—a computer capable of compiling and running your creations. In this section, we’ll outline the minimum requirements for your workstation, compare the development experience on Mac and Windows, and help you choose the best option for your magical coding journey.

=== Minimum requirements

To create and compile Go-based command-line applications, ensure your workstation meets these minimum requirements:

**Processor**: A 64-bit processor (Intel or ARM).

**Memory**: At least 4 GB of RAM (8 GB or more is recommended for smoother multitasking).

**Storage**: At least 2 GB of free disk space for the Go compiler, dependencies, and your projects.

**Operating System**:

- **Mac**: macOS 10.13 or later.
- **Windows**: Windows 10 or later.
- **Linux**: Ubuntu-based (preferably Linux Mint, apt-based).

**Network**: Internet access for downloading the Go toolchain, dependencies, and updates.

These requirements ensure that your workstation is equipped to handle the Go compiler and run the applications you create efficiently.

=== A laptop is ideal

A laptop offers unparalleled flexibility and convenience for coding, making it an excellent choice for learners. Here are some of its advantages:

**Portability**: A laptop allows you to code anywhere—whether at home, in a café, or at a library. This flexibility can help you maintain a consistent learning routine.

**All-in-one design**: Laptops combine essential components like a screen, keyboard, and trackpad into a single device, simplifying your setup and eliminating the need for additional peripherals.

**Battery-powered**: Laptops can run on battery power, allowing you to continue learning even during power outages or when you don’t have immediate access to an outlet.

**Cross-platform testing**: Many laptops can dual-boot or run virtual machines, enabling you to test your code across different operating systems (Mac and Windows).

**Cost-effective for beginners**: Entry-level laptops that meet the minimum requirements are often more affordable than desktop setups, making them a practical choice for new coders.

**Real-world preparation**: Many professional developers use laptops for their day-to-day work. Learning to code on a laptop helps you familiarize yourself with the tools and workflows you’re likely to encounter in the industry.

**Collaboration and mobility**: A laptop is easy to take to coding meetups, workshops, or classes, where collaboration with peers can enhance your learning experience.

While desktops offer raw power and larger screens, the mobility and convenience of a laptop often make it the preferred choice for learners and professionals alike.

=== Mac vs. Windows vs. Linux

When it comes to development, the choice between Mac, Windows, and Linux often depends on preference and compatibility with development tools. Here’s why many developers lean toward Mac:

**Native Unix-like environment**: Mac provides a Unix-based operating system out of the box, which is closer to the environments where Go originated. UNIX predates Linux by a decade and Mac is officially the largest UNIX distribution on the planet. This means you can use tools like `bash` and `vim` without additional configuration, creating a seamless experience for Go developers.

**Cross-platform consistency**: The Go toolchain and libraries often behave more consistently on Unix-like systems (like Mac). This consistency can save you from troubleshooting environment-specific issues that sometimes occur on Windows.

**Performance**: Macs (especially those with Apple Silicon processors) are optimized for performance and energy efficiency, making them an excellent choice for compiling and running Go applications. Plus they need very little power allowing you to take your magic on the road.

**Brew**: The "missing" package manager (`brew`) simplifies installing tools like Go, enhancing the development experience.

On the other hand, Windows offers its own strengths:

**Familiarity**: For developers transitioning from a non-Unix background, Windows might feel more familiar and comfortable.

**Git Bash**: Installing Git Bash provides a Unix-like shell environment, bridging the gap between Windows and Unix-based systems. This simplifies the use of tools like `bash` and `vim` without requiring additional configuration.

**Winget**: The Windows Package Manager (`winget`) simplifies installing tools like Go, enhancing the development experience.

While both Mac and Windows can serve as capable workstations, Mac’s Unix-based environment, seamless toolchain integration, and developer-centric design make it the preferred choice for many Go developers. However, if you’re already comfortable with Windows or prefer its ecosystem, modern tools like Git Bash make it a viable option.

As much as we _love_ Linux, it really isn't an option for most beginners because it has to be installed either as container engine, virtual machine, or onto "bare metal" with a USB stick. These are _definitely_ worth learning, eventually. But for now we are just starting out so Mac and Windows are totally fine. Besides, most schools wouldn't even know how to install Linux in their labs even if they wanted to, and if they did, would have a lot more work to keep their Linux lab up and running. Some do, and they are _amazing_, but most are content to just the most common desktop OSes.

Choose the workstation that suits your needs best and ensure it meets the minimum requirements—your enchanted coding journey awaits!
