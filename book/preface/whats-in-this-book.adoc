== What's included in the book

This book is focused on learning to code in Go from the terminal command line and everything that requires for an absolute beginner who has never even heard of a terminal before, that's it, nothing more. It is very rewarding creating command-line programs from the command-line itself. We want to get doing that as fast as possible, but some stuff cannot be skipped to get there. Anything that can, has been.

=== The Code-Mage (cm) command

I created Code-Mage to skip a lot of that setup stuff with `cm init` in a way that you can come back to later and understand it if you want. But that's not all it can do:

- Dynamically display contextual help while you are typing
- Validate your work and catch bugs as you progress
- Create unit tests if you'd rather not type them in every time
- Time how long it takes you to complete a challenge
- Run a web-server for certain projects that require it
- Display community news and announcements
- Read this book in your web browser without Internet

I won't lie, I'm very proud of Code-Mage. I really wish I had it when I was learning. In fact, making the things you wish you had is a great way to find project ideas and motivation. The source code for Code-Mage is entirely public domain and open for review so you can compile and install your own if you feel uncomfortable—as you should—trusting a downloadable executable from the Internet. More on that later (see Preparation).
