== What's with the magic thing?

Yes, the magic stuff is absolutely sillyâ€”on purpose. Self-proclaimed "serious" people and pedagogues (not necessary one and the same) seem to find fault with what is a well-established scientific principle of memory: silliness. Human brains are hard-coded to remember silly narratives and images. This is how memory competitors memorize Pi to 100,000 digits, by creating a silly, colorful narrative in their brain that they replay related to each of the numbers as they walk through a "memory palace," a mental map of a familiar location where each story occupies a specific spot containing different sets of numbers. Coming up with your own silly stories to associate with coding skills is the best, but all this talk about magic and mages is a head-start. If it's not your thing, there are plenty of other boring books covering nearly the same stuff to slog through (most of which are 10 years out of date).
