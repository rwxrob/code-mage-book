== Supplement your reading

This book is but a part of a more complete personal learning strategy. Make sure not to neglect the other parts:

=== Join a community

Humans are social creatures and learning is communal. Join a community that is focused on learning the same things as you. Meetups, hacker spaces, clubs, church groups, social media, and live streamer chat groups are all great places to find a community. The community is a place to collaborate and share peer reviews of one another's learning and projects.

My sincere hope is that the parents, teachers, and mages reading these words will find opportunities and motivation to create their own coding clubs and communities dedicated to helping others master the art of code and computer science and reap all the well-earned benefits of doing so.

=== Find a mentor

Humans have been passing knowledge one to another since the beginning. It's what we do. Luckily learning happens naturally when someone with experience and knowledge is available to someone who knows how to ask questions, apply what they learn, and return with more questions. That's you, the inquisitive one. The mentor's job is to answer questions and provide feedback—*not* to "teach" you. 

Most mentors won't have that kind of free time available to constantly lead you by the hand on your learning journey. In fact, the more likely you are to hear from someone, the less likely you are to want to learn what they have to say. There are those who _do_ stuff and those that _talk about_ doing stuff. The more someone talks about doing stuff the less time they have to actually do something. It's important to find people you know who are regularly and actively engaged in doing the thing you want to learn and then approach them about possibly mentoring you, perhaps for a small fee (most will decline).

You will find that many people _want_ to share what they know but just don't know how to do it or who would want to hear. Find these people and approach them. Perhaps you can find a few mentors so you can compare how they differ in their approach to programming.

=== Become a mentor

You don't need any special training to be a mentor for someone else. In fact, as a beginner who has recently mastered something you are perhaps the best suited to help another beginner learn it because _how_ you learned it is still fresh in your mind. Those with experience might be masters but often have difficulty remembering how they learned it and how to help others learn it as well. So don't be shy by offering your help. And remember, you really haven't learned it until you can succinctly help another learn it as well.

=== Consider AI assistance

In my experience ChatGPT is great for overall help with life, writing, and project organization—particularly from a phone over voice. Claude is better at code help and only has an API integration making it great for plugging into popular coding tools (like `mods` from Charmbracelet).

Although I have nothing to do with any AI company, I do strongly believe in it as a learning platform and use it regularly to get answers and discuss topics 24 hours a day—even while riding my bike, code the boring stuff, and regularly practice my conversational and written Russian and French language. In fact, AI help with much of this book—especially the parts that must be validated to be sure they work (which I wish other coding books would do).

I highly recommend getting an AI learning assistant like ChatGPT as soon as possible. In my experience, such assistants are almost always better than than a random search of the Internet full of popular but incorrect answers to the same common questions that an assistant could better help with. My assistant is never tired of answering my questions even when my mentors or friends are.

On demand learning exponentially increases when an AI is involved. Nothing breaks through frustration and loneliness better when taking on learning challenges like a supportive AI companion even when a helpful human mentor is also available.

I believe we are quickly approaching a time when the digital divide will no longer be just between those who have computers and Internet access and those who do not, but between those who have learned to leverage a personal AI assistant loaded with contextual history and those who have not. We are already seeing this difference around us every day.
