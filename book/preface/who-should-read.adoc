== Who should read this book

This book is written for anyone wanting to learn—or help someone learn—practical computer science and programming for real applications development. While we have fun with the whole fantasy magic theme, everything in this book is very real and might even get you a job someday. It is true that this book can be reliably used as a text book for absolute beginners with enough algebra to understand what a mathematical function is but this book very clearly includes everyone _outside_ of educational institutions. In fact, I wrote it mostly with pro-active parents in mind who want to give their kids a head-start in tech that they simply cannot find in most traditional education systems, the same reason, in fact, that I started SKILSTAK Coding Arts in 2013 with my own retirement money.
